Here is how custom levels will work:

First a header:
-----------
LevelName

VersionNumber
-----------

Next, Level specific settings:
-----------
GameStyle
StartBall
CameraStyle
LevelScale
-----------
For the first and third, they will be a number where:
0 - hamsterball
1 - ballance
2 - marble blast gold

For the second, it'll be a number where:
0=HB, 1=WB, 2=SB, 3=PB, 4=M

LevelScale is a float number that determines the relative size of the entire level compared to the ball

The next lines are dependent on the gamestyle chosen:
(See globalVaribles.cs for specifics)

Note: The Start of the level is at 0,0,0
Note: For all position and scale numbers that follow, decimal numbers are allowed, but they won't be supported by the editor

Next, all big ground blocks:
-----------
posx,posy,posz:sizex,sizey,sizez
posx,posy,posz:sizex,sizey,sizez
etc.
-----------
it has the position, followed by the size of the block.
(the position is the center of the block)

Next, all individual objects:
-----------
style:id:posx,posy,posz:rotation
style:id:posx,posy,posz:rotation
etc.
-----------
style is the specific list of objects that the object comes from:
0=basic
1=HB
2=Ballance
3=MBG

id is the name of the specific type of object
posx,posy,posz is the position
rotation is a number where
0=0, 1=90, 2=180, 3=270
